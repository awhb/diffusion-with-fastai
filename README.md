Diffusion with FastAI
================

## Overview

This course repository tracks my progress following [part 2](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html) of fast.ai's 2022-23 course.
During the course we will be building a deep learning framework called "miniai" from scratch. It is created from Jupyter notebooks using `nbdev`.

**As a side note, I plan to adapt parts of this library to aid students in NUS CS2109S (Introduction to AI and Machine Learning) in their learning of the heavy syllabus.**

## Install

Clone this repo, `cd` to it, and run:

``` sh
pip install -e .
```

(You may optionally create a virtual environment first)

This installs the `miniai` library which I will be learning to create through the fast.ai course. 

## Using Jupyter notebooks

1. Notebooks can be found in the `nbs` subfolder.
2. Copy the notebook from the `nbs` subfolder into the `miniai` subfolder. 
3. Run the notebooks using the local environment (with miniai module installed) as a Jupyter kernel (VSCode functionality).
4. Running the cells with export functionality periodically exports the code within the notebooks to the files in miniai (preliminary versions are already initialised but feel free to iterate)
