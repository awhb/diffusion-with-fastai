Diffusion with FastAI
================

## Overview

This course repository tracks my progress following [part 2](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html) of fast.ai's 2022-23 course.
During the course we will be building a deep learning framework called "miniai" from scratch. It is created from Jupyter notebooks using `nbdev`.
As a side note, I plan to adapt parts of this library to aid students in NUS CS2109S (Introduction to AI and Machine Learning) in their learning of the heavy syllabus.

## Install

Clone this repo, `cd` to it, and run:

``` sh
pip install -e .
```

This installs the `miniai` library which I will be learning to create through the fast.ai course.
